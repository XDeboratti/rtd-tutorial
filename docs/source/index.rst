GGNN Documentation
===================================

GGNN is a library for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN), utilizing the massive parallelism offered by GPUs. 
It is written in C++ and has Python 3 wrappers, so it can be used from both languages.
The library is based on the work leading to the paper `GGNN: Graph-based GPU Nearest Neighbor
Search <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01059>`_ by Fabian Groh, Lukas Ruppert, Patrick Wieschollek, and Hendrik P.A. Lensch.

Check out the :doc:`_install` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`install<_install>` the project.
