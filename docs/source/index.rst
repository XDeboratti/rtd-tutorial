GGNN Documentation
===================================

The library ggnn offers an efficient algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) utilizing the massive parallelism offered by GPUs. 
It is written in C++ and has Python 3 wrappers, so it can be used from both languages.
The library is based on the method proposed in the paper `GGNN: Graph-based GPU Nearest Neighbor
Search <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01059>`_ by Fabian Groh, Lukas Ruppert, Patrick Wieschollek, and Hendrik P.A. Lensch.

Check out the :doc:`install` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`compile <Install_Cpp_Library>` the project and the :doc:`usage` section for a short tutorial and code examples.
